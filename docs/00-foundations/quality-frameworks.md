### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

**Core Principles:**

#### 1. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
```
SLI (Service Level Indicator)
      ↓
SLO (Service Level Objective)
      ↓
SLA (Service Level Agreement)
```

**Example SLOs:**
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Latency: 95% of requests < 100ms
- Error rate: < 0.1% of requests

#### 2. Error Budgets
```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO
```

**Example:**
- SLO: 99.9% availability
- Error Budget: 0.1% = 43.2 minutes/month

**Policy:**
- Budget remaining → New features
- Budget exhausted → Focus on reliability

#### 3. Blameless Postmortems
**Template:**
```markdown
1. Summary
2. Timeline
3. Root Cause
4. Resolution
5. Lessons Learned
6. Action Items
```

#### 4. Automation
- Eliminate toil
- Scale operations
- Reduce human error
- Improve reliability

#### 5. Monitoring and Alerting
**Four Golden Signals:**
1. **Latency**: Time to serve request
2. **Traffic**: Demand on system
3. **Errors**: Failed requests
4. **Saturation**: Resource utilization
