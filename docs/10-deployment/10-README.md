# Deployment

## Purpose

Master deployment strategies and practices to deliver software to production safely, reliably, and with minimal risk. This module covers modern deployment approaches that enable continuous delivery and rapid feedback.

## Context

Deployment is the critical phase where code transitions from development to production. The right deployment strategy minimizes risk, enables fast rollback, and supports continuous delivery practices essential for high-performing teams.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of [CI/CD Pipeline](../08-cicd-pipeline/README.md)
- Knowledge of [Version Control](../03-version-control/README.md)
- Familiarity with [Feature Flags](../07-development-practices/feature-flags.md)
- [Incident Management](../11-incident-management/README.md) awareness

## Why Deployment Strategy Matters

### Modern Deployment Requirements

```
Traditional Deployment:
- Manual process
- Downtime windows
- All-or-nothing release
- Slow rollback
- High risk

Modern Deployment:
- Automated process
- Zero downtime
- Gradual rollout
- Instant rollback
- Low risk
```

### Impact on DORA Metrics

**Deployment strategies directly influence:**

- **Deployment Frequency**: Blue-green enables multiple deploys/day
- **Lead Time**: Automated deployments reduce time from commit to production
- **Change Failure Rate**: Gradual rollouts limit blast radius
- **MTTR**: Instant rollback reduces recovery time

## Deployment Strategies Overview

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy        | Downtime | Rollback | Cost   | Complexity | Best For        |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Recreate**    | Yes      | Fast     | Low    | Low        | Dev/test        |
| **Rolling**     | No       | Slow     | Low    | Low        | Stateless apps  |
| **Blue-Green**  | No       | Instant  | High   | Medium     | Critical apps   |
| **Canary**      | No       | Fast     | Medium | High       | Risk-averse     |
| **A/B Testing** | No       | Fast     | Medium | High       | Feature testing |
| **Shadow**      | No       | N/A      | High   | Very High  | Safe validation |

### When to Use Each Strategy

```markdown
**Recreate (Big Bang):**

- Development environments
- Maintenance windows acceptable
- Non-critical applications

**Rolling Update:**

- Stateless web applications
- Backward-compatible changes
- Standard production deployments

**Blue-Green:**

- Mission-critical systems
- E-commerce platforms
- When instant rollback essential
- Financial applications

**Canary:**

- High-traffic applications
- Gradual user exposure needed
- Real-user validation required
- Risk-averse organizations

**A/B Testing:**

- UI/UX optimization
- Feature validation
- Business metric optimization
- Data-driven decisions

**Shadow:**

- Major refactoring validation
- Performance comparison
- Algorithm testing
- Zero-risk production testing
```

## Deployment Best Practices

### Automation First

```markdown
✅ **Automate Everything:**

- Build process
- Test execution
- Deployment scripts
- Health checks
- Rollback procedures

❌ **Avoid Manual Steps:**

- Manual file copying
- Manual configuration changes
- Manual database updates
- Manual rollback
```

### Feature Flags for Safety

```javascript
// Deploy code without exposing features
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('new-checkout', user)) {
  return <NewCheckoutFlow />;
} else {
  return <CurrentCheckoutFlow />;
}

// Gradual rollout: 1% → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
```

### Monitoring and Rollback

```markdown
**Monitor During Deployment:**

- Error rates
- Response times
- Resource utilization
- Business metrics
- User feedback

**Automated Rollback Triggers:**

- Error rate > 1%
- Latency p99 > 2x baseline
- Health check failures
- Critical metrics degradation
```

## Deployment Pipeline Example

### Complete CD Pipeline

```yaml
# Deployment automation workflow
stages:
  - build # Compile and package
  - test # Run all tests
  - deploy-staging # Deploy to staging
  - smoke-test # Verify staging
  - deploy-canary # 10% production
  - monitor # Watch metrics
  - deploy-prod # Full production
  - verify # Post-deployment checks
```

### Progressive Deployment

```markdown
**Phase 1: Staging (10 minutes)**

- Deploy to staging environment
- Run automated tests
- Manual smoke testing
- Stakeholder review

**Phase 2: Canary (1 hour)**

- Deploy to 10% of production
- Monitor error rates and latency
- Check business metrics
- Validate with real users

**Phase 3: Production (2 hours)**

- Gradually increase to 100%
- Continue monitoring
- Keep old version ready
- Document deployment

**Phase 4: Cleanup (24 hours)**

- Remove old version
- Clean up feature flags
- Update documentation
- Conduct retrospective
```

## Database Deployments

### Zero-Downtime Migrations

```markdown
**Backward-Compatible Pattern:**

Phase 1: Expand

- Add new column (nullable)
- Deploy application code (supports both old and new)
- Backfill data

Phase 2: Migrate

- Dual-write to old and new columns
- Monitor for issues
- Validate data consistency

Phase 3: Contract

- Remove old column
- Deploy code using only new column
- Clean up migration code
```

### Migration Best Practices

```markdown
✅ **Safe Migrations:**

- Always backward-compatible
- Test with production data volume
- Time-boxed execution
- Rollback plan ready
- Zero downtime required

❌ **Dangerous Migrations:**

- Breaking changes without transition
- Untested on production-size data
- No rollback plan
- Requires downtime
```

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Database Migrations

```markdown

- Config management (Ansible, Chef)
- Environment-specific configs
- Secrets management (Vault)
```

### Challenge 3: Rollback Complexity

```markdown
**Problem:** Cannot roll back database migrations

**Solution:**

- Design reversible migrations
- Keep old code compatible
- Use feature flags for new features
- Test rollback procedures
```

## Success Criteria
