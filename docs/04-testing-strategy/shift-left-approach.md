# Shift-Left Testing Approach

## Purpose
Comprehensive guide to shift-left testing—moving testing activities earlier in the development lifecycle to find and fix defects sooner, reducing costs and improving quality.

## Overview
Shift-left testing means:
- Testing earlier in development
- Preventing defects vs finding them
- Faster feedback loops
- Lower cost of fixing issues
- Higher quality outcomes

## What is Shift-Left Testing?

### Definition
Shift-left testing is the practice of performing testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), moving quality assurance "left" on the project timeline.

### The Cost of Defects

```
Cost to Fix Defects by Phase:

Requirements  ────  $1        (Baseline)
Design        ────  $5        (5x more expensive)
Development   ────  $10       (10x more expensive)
Testing       ────  $15       (15x more expensive)
Production    ────  $100      (100x more expensive)

Shift-Left Goal: Catch issues in Requirements/Design phase
```

### Traditional vs Shift-Left

```
Traditional Approach (Shift-Right):

Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment
                                        ↑
                              Testing happens here
                              (Too late, expensive fixes)


Shift-Left Approach:

Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment
    ↓           ↓          ↓            ↓
  Testing     Testing    Testing      Testing
  (Continuous testing throughout)
```

## Shift-Left Strategies

### 1. Requirements Testing

#### Static Requirements Review

```markdown
# Requirements Review Checklist

Completeness:
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] All edge cases identified
- [ ] Non-functional requirements defined
- [ ] Dependencies documented

Clarity:
- [ ] No ambiguous language
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Testable requirements

Feasibility:
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Resource availability checked
- [ ] Timeline realistic
- [ ] Risks identified

Testability:
- [ ] Clear success criteria
- [ ] Measurable outcomes
- [ ] Test data identifiable
- [ ] Environment requirements known
```

#### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

```gherkin
Feature: User Registration
  As a new user
  I want to register for an account
  So that I can access the platform

  Background:
    Given the registration page is accessible
    And the email service is available

  Scenario: Successful registration
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter valid email "user@example.com"
    And I enter valid password "SecurePass123!"
    And I confirm my password
    And I click "Register"
    Then I should see "Registration successful"
    And I should receive a verification email
    And my account should be created with "pending" status

  Scenario: Invalid email format
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter invalid email "not-an-email"
    And I click "Register"
    Then I should see "Please enter a valid email address"
    And no account should be created

  Scenario: Duplicate email
    Given a user exists with email "existing@example.com"
    When I try to register with email "existing@example.com"
    Then I should see "Email already registered"
    And I should be prompted to login or reset password
```

### 2. Design Testing

#### Architecture Review

```markdown
# Architecture Review Questions

Scalability:
- Can the system handle expected load?
- What are the bottlenecks?
- How does it scale horizontally/vertically?

Security:
- Are security best practices followed?
- Is data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are authentication/authorization proper?
- Are inputs validated?

Testability:
- Can components be tested in isolation?
- Are dependencies injectable?
- Is logging adequate?
- Can we mock external services?

Maintainability:
- Is the architecture clear and documented?
- Are responsibilities well-separated?
- Is technical debt manageable?
- Can new features be added easily?
```

#### Design Patterns Validation

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Dependency Injection (Testable)
class OrderService {
  constructor(paymentService, emailService, database) {
    this.paymentService = paymentService;
    this.emailService = emailService;
    this.database = database;
  }

  async createOrder(orderData) {
    const order = await this.database.save(orderData);
    await this.paymentService.charge(order);
    await this.emailService.sendConfirmation(order);
    return order;
  }
}

// ❌ Bad: Tight Coupling (Hard to Test)
class OrderService {
  async createOrder(orderData) {
    const db = new Database(); // Hard-coded dependency
    const payment = new StripePayment(); // Can't mock
    const email = new SendGridEmail(); // Can't test without real service

    const order = await db.save(orderData);
    await payment.charge(order);
    await email.send(order);
    return order;
  }
}
```

### 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

```javascript
// Step 1: RED - Write failing test
describe('Calculator', () => {
  it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculator = new Calculator();
    expect(calculator.add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });
});

// Run test → FAILS (Calculator doesn't exist)

// Step 2: GREEN - Minimal code to pass
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

// Run test → PASSES

// Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve code
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
      throw new TypeError('Both arguments must be numbers');
    }
    return a + b;
  }
}

// Run test → Still PASSES
// Add tests for error cases...
```

#### TDD Benefits

```
TDD Advantages:

├── Forces thinking about API first
├── Encourages modularity
├── Promotes SOLID principles
└── Results in testable code

Higher Quality
├── Tests written for all code
├── Edge cases considered upfront
├── Regression suite grows naturally
└── Confidence to refactor

Living Documentation
├── Tests show how to use code
├── Examples for all scenarios
├── Always up-to-date
└── Self-documenting
```

### 4. Static Code Analysis

#### Linting

```javascript
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:security/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": "error",
    "no-eval": "error",
    "no-implied-eval": "error",
    "no-var": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error",
    "eqeqeq": ["error", "always"],
    "complexity": ["error", 10],
    "max-depth": ["error", 3],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", 50]
  }
}
```

#### Type Checking

```typescript
// TypeScript catches errors at compile time
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function getUserName(user: User): string {
  return user.name;
}

// ✅ Valid
getUserName({ id: 1, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' });

// ❌ Type error caught before runtime
getUserName({ id: 1, name: 'John' }); // Missing 'email'
getUserName({ id: '1', name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' }); // Wrong type for 'id'
```

#### Security Scanning

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
name: Security Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate

      - name: Run Snyk
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}

      - name: Run SAST scan
        uses: securego/gosec@master
```
