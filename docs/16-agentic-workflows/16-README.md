# Agentic Workflows for Quality Assurance

## Purpose
Provide comprehensive guidance on building and deploying autonomous AI agent workflows that transform quality assurance from human-driven processes to intelligent, self-improving systems capable of planning, executing, and optimizing testing strategies autonomously.

## Context
While AI assistants (Module 15) augment human QA engineers, **agentic workflows** represent the next evolution: autonomous systems that can reason, plan, take actions, learn from results, and collaborate with other agents to achieve complex QA objectives. This module bridges from AI-assisted QA to fully autonomous quality management systems.

## Prerequisites
- Complete understanding of [AI in Quality Assurance](../15-ai-in-quality-assurance/15-README.md)
- Experience with [Building AI QA Assistant](../15-ai-in-quality-assurance/building-ai-qa-assistant.md)
- Python 3.10+ and familiarity with async programming
- Understanding of [Testing Strategy](../04-testing-strategy/README.md) and [CI/CD Pipeline](../08-cicd-pipeline/README.md)

## What Are Agentic Workflows?

### From Tools → Assistants → Agents → Agent Workflows

### Agent vs Traditional Approach

| Task | Traditional QA | AI Assistant | **Agentic Workflow** |
|------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Test Planning** | QA engineer creates plan | AI suggests test cases | **Agent analyzes code, risks, coverage gaps, generates comprehensive plan autonomously** |
| **Test Creation** | Manual test writing | AI generates tests on request | **Agent continuously creates/updates tests as code changes** |
| **Test Maintenance** | Manual updates when tests break | AI suggests fixes | **Agent detects failures, analyzes root cause, auto-fixes or adapts tests** |
| **Code Review** | Human reviewer | AI provides suggestions | **Multi-agent team reviews in parallel (security, performance, etc.), synthesizes report** |
| **Bug Triage** | Manual priority assignment | AI recommends priority | **Agent analyzes impact, assigns priority, routes to right team, tracks resolution** |
| **Incident Response** | On-call engineer investigates | AI assists with log analysis | **Agent detects anomaly, investigates, attempts remediation, escalates if needed** |

## Quick Start Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Your First Agent (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Build a test generation agent using LangGraph

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def analyze_function(code: str) -> str:
    """Analyze a function to understand what needs testing."""
    return f"Function complexity: 7, edge cases: ['null input', 'empty string', 'very long string']"

@tool
def generate_test(function_name: str, edge_cases: list) -> str:
    """Generate test code for the function."""
    return f"Generated 5 tests for {function_name} covering {len(edge_cases)} edge cases"

# Create agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=[analyze_function, generate_test])

# Run agent
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [("user", "Create comprehensive tests for the validateEmail function")]
})

print(result['messages'][-1].content)
```

**Output**: Agent autonomously analyzes function → identifies edge cases → generates tests

---

### Scenario 2: Self-Healing Test Suite (1 day)
**Goal**: Deploy agent that monitors and fixes broken tests

**Agent Workflow:**
```
1. Monitor: Detect test failures in CI
2. Analyze: Determine if failure is test issue or code issue
3. Decide: Can auto-fix or needs human review?
4. Act: Update test selectors/assertions or flag for review
5. Verify: Re-run tests to confirm fix
6. Learn: Update knowledge base with failure pattern
```

**Value**: 70% reduction in test maintenance time

---

### Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Code Review (3 days)
**Goal**: Deploy specialized agent team for comprehensive PR review

**Agent Team:**
- **Security Agent**: Scans for vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- **Performance Agent**: Identifies inefficiencies, N+1 queries
- **Accessibility Agent**: Checks WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Best Practices Agent**: Enforces team conventions
- **Summary Agent**: Synthesizes findings, prioritizes issues

**Value**: 90% faster than human review, catches 40% more issues

---

### Scenario 4: Autonomous Incident Response (1 week)
**Goal**: Deploy agent workflow that handles production incidents

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Monitoring
    Monitoring --> AnomalyDetected: Alert triggered
    AnomalyDetected --> InvestigateRoot: Analyze logs
    InvestigateRoot --> AssessImpact: Correlate events
    AssessImpact --> AttemptRemediation: Low risk
    AssessImpact --> EscalateHuman: High risk
    AttemptRemediation --> VerifyResolution
    VerifyResolution --> GeneratePostmortem
    GeneratePostmortem --> [*]
    VerifyResolution --> EscalateHuman: Failed
    EscalateHuman --> GeneratePostmortem: Resolved
```

**Value**: 80% of incidents resolved without human intervention, MTTR reduced by 60%

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Agent with Tools
**Use Case**: Focused tasks with clear tool requirements

```python
# Agent has access to specific tools
tools = [run_tests, analyze_failures, fix_selectors, commit_changes]
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools)

# Agent autonomously decides which tools to use and when
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [("user", "Fix failing E2E tests")]})
```

**Pros**: Simple, predictable, easy to debug
**Cons**: Limited to single perspective/expertise

---

### Pattern 2: Sequential Agent Chain
**Use Case**: Multi-step workflows with dependencies

```python
# Agent 1: Analyze code changes
analysis_agent = AnalysisAgent()
analysis = analysis_agent.run(pr_diff)

# Agent 2: Generate tests (uses analysis output)
test_gen_agent = TestGenerationAgent()
tests = test_gen_agent.run(analysis)

# Agent 3: Review tests (uses both outputs)
review_agent = ReviewAgent()
review = review_agent.run(tests, analysis)
```

**Pros**: Clear flow, specialized agents, composable
**Cons**: Sequential bottleneck, no parallelization

---

### Pattern 3: Parallel Multi-Agent
**Use Case**: Multiple independent perspectives needed

```python
# All agents run simultaneously
agents = [
    SecurityAgent(),
    PerformanceAgent(),
    AccessibilityAgent(),
    CodeQualityAgent()
]

# Execute in parallel
results = await asyncio.gather(*[agent.run(code) for agent in agents])

# Synthesize results
summary = SummaryAgent().synthesize(results)
```

**Pros**: Fast, comprehensive, specialized expertise
**Cons**: Requires coordination, potential conflicts

---

### Pattern 4: Hierarchical Supervisor
**Use Case**: Complex workflows requiring coordination

```python
# Supervisor agent delegates to worker agents
class SupervisorAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workers = {
            'test_gen': TestGenerationAgent(),
            'code_review': CodeReviewAgent(),
            'deployment': DeploymentAgent()
        }

    def run(self, task):
        # Supervisor decides which agents to use
        plan = self.plan(task)

        # Delegate to workers
        results = []
        for step in plan:
            worker = self.workers[step.agent]
            result = worker.run(step.task)
            results.append(result)

        return self.synthesize(results)
```

**Pros**: Flexible, adaptive, handles complex scenarios
**Cons**: More complex, supervisor can be bottleneck

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Over-Autonomy
**Problem**: Agent makes critical decisions without human approval

**Solution**: Implement approval gates
```python
if decision.risk_level == "HIGH":
    approval = await request_human_approval(decision)
    if not approval:
        return fallback_action
```

---

### Pitfall 2: Hallucination Cascade
**Problem**: Agent makes up information, subsequent agents compound error

**Solution**: Verification checkpoints
```python
# After each agent step, verify outputs
def verify_output(output, sources):
    if not all_claims_grounded_in_sources(output, sources):
        raise HallucinationError("Ungrounded claim detected")
```

---

### Pitfall 3: Runaway Costs
**Problem**: Agent loops indefinitely or makes excessive API calls

**Solution**: Budget controls
```python
class CostControlledAgent:
    def __init__(self, max_cost_per_task=1.00):
        self.max_cost = max_cost_per_task
        self.current_cost = 0

    def run(self, task):
        if self.current_cost >= self.max_cost:
            raise BudgetExceededError()
        # ... execute task
```

---

### Pitfall 4: Black Box Decisions
**Problem**: Can't explain why agent took specific action

**Solution**: Reasoning logs and trace visualization
```python
# LangGraph automatically provides execution traces
for event in agent.stream_events():
    log_agent_reasoning(
        agent=event.agent_name,
        thought=event.reasoning,
        action=event.action,
        result=event.result
    )
```
