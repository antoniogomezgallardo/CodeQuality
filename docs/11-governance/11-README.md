## Quality Standards & Guidelines

### Coding Standards

#### Universal Coding Principles
1. **Readability First**: Code is read more than written
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing well
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate duplication
4. **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
5. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build for hypothetical futures

#### Language-Specific Standards

**JavaScript/TypeScript Standards**
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Descriptive names, single responsibility
function calculateOrderTotal(order) {
  const subtotal = order.items.reduce((sum, item) =>
    sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0
  );
  const tax = calculateTax(subtotal, order.taxRate);
  const shipping = calculateShipping(order);
  return subtotal + tax + shipping;
}

// ❌ Bad: Unclear naming, multiple responsibilities
function calc(o) {
  let t = 0;
  for(let i of o.i) {
    t += i.p * i.q;
  }
  t = t * 1.1; // tax
  t += 10; // shipping
  return t;
}
```

**Java Standards**
```java
// ✅ Good: Clear structure, proper documentation
/**
 * Calculates the total price for an order including tax and shipping.
 *
 * @param order The order to calculate
 * @return Total price including all charges
 */
public BigDecimal calculateOrderTotal(Order order) {
    BigDecimal subtotal = order.getItems().stream()
        .map(item -> item.getPrice().multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(item.getQuantity())))
        .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);

    BigDecimal tax = taxCalculator.calculate(subtotal, order.getTaxRate());
    BigDecimal shipping = shippingCalculator.calculate(order);

    return subtotal.add(tax).add(shipping);
}
```

### Documentation Standards

#### Code Documentation Requirements

**Class/Module Level**
```typescript
/**
 * Manages user authentication and session handling.
 *
 * @module AuthenticationService
 * @requires TokenService
 * @requires UserRepository
 *
 * @example
 * const authService = new AuthenticationService(tokenService, userRepo);
 * const session = await authService.login(credentials);
 */
```

**Function/Method Level**
```python
def process_payment(order_id: str, payment_method: PaymentMethod) -> PaymentResult:
    """
    Process payment for an order using the specified payment method.

    Args:
        order_id: Unique identifier for the order
        payment_method: Payment method containing card or account details

    Returns:
        PaymentResult containing transaction ID and status

    Raises:
        PaymentException: If payment processing fails
        OrderNotFoundException: If order does not exist

    Example:
        >>> result = process_payment("ORD-123", credit_card)
        >>> print(result.transaction_id)
    """
```

### Testing Standards

#### Test Coverage Requirements

```yaml
coverage_requirements:
  minimum:
    lines: 80%
    branches: 75%
    functions: 80%
    statements: 80%

  critical_modules:
    payment_processing: 95%
    authentication: 95%
    data_encryption: 100%

  exclusions:
    - "*/test/*"
    - "*/mock/*"
    - "*/generated/*"
```

#### Test Naming Conventions

```javascript
// Test suite structure
describe('OrderService', () => {
  describe('calculateTotal', () => {
    it('should calculate correct total with single item', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should apply discount when coupon is valid', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should throw error when order is empty', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Quality Gates

### Definition
Quality gates are checkpoints in the development process where specific quality criteria must be met before proceeding to the next phase.

### Quality Gate Implementation

#### Development Quality Gates

  exit 1
fi

# Unit tests
npm run test:unit
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Unit tests failed"
