# AI in QA Implementation Roadmap

## Purpose

Provide a practical, phased approach to adopting AI in Quality Assurance, minimizing risk while maximizing value delivery and team adoption.

## Context

Implementing AI in QA is a journey, not a destination. This roadmap guides teams from initial exploration through full production deployment, with clear milestones, deliverables, and success criteria at each phase.

## Prerequisites

- Management buy-in and budget allocation
- Team willingness to learn new technologies
- Access to LLM APIs or ability to run local models
- Historical data for ML models (at least 30-90 days)

## Implementation Philosophy

**Core Principles:**

1. **Start Small** - Begin with low-risk, high-value use cases
2. **Measure Everything** - Track ROI from day one
3. **Iterate Fast** - 2-week sprints, continuous feedback
4. **Learn Publicly** - Share wins and failures with team
5. **Human-in-Loop** - AI assists, humans decide
