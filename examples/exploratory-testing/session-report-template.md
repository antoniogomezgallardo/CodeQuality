## üêõ Issues Discovered

### Critical Issues (P1)
*None found*

### High Priority Issues (P2)

#### Issue #ET-001: Misleading Error Message on Account Lockout
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Security and User Experience

**Description:**
When an account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts, the error message "Invalid username or password" is displayed instead of informing the user about the account lockout.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Attempt to login with wrong password 5 times
2. Try to login with correct password
3. Observe error message

**Expected Result:** "Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."
**Actual Result:** "Invalid username or password"

**Risk:** Users may continue trying to login, not understanding why correct credentials are failing.

**Screenshot:** [Attached: account-lockout-error.png]

#### Issue #ET-002: No Visual Feedback During Password Reset Request
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** User Experience

**Description:**
When clicking "Send Reset Email" button, there's no immediate visual feedback, causing users to click multiple times.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to password reset page
2. Enter valid email address
3. Click "Send Reset Email" button
4. Observe lack of loading indicator

**Expected Result:** Loading spinner or button state change to indicate processing
**Actual Result:** No visual feedback, button remains clickable

**Risk:** Users may submit multiple reset requests thinking the first didn't work.

### Medium Priority Issues (P3)

#### Issue #ET-003: Password Strength Indicator Missing
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** User Experience and Security

**Description:**
During password creation/reset, there's no real-time feedback about password strength, making it difficult for users to create compliant passwords.

**Improvement Suggestion:**
Add a password strength meter that updates in real-time as users type, showing:
- Length requirement (8+ characters)
- Character type requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- Overall strength rating

#### Issue #ET-004: Remember Me Checkbox Not Persistent
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** User Experience

**Description:**
The "Remember Me" checkbox state is not preserved between login attempts, requiring users to check it every time.

**Expected Behavior:** Checkbox should remember the user's last preference

### Low Priority Issues (P4)

#### Issue #ET-005: Login Form Not Optimized for Password Managers
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** User Experience

**Description:**
Login form lacks proper autocomplete attributes, making it difficult for password managers to correctly identify and fill fields.

**Improvement Suggestion:**
Add appropriate autocomplete attributes:
- `autocomplete="username"` for email field
- `autocomplete="current-password"` for password field
