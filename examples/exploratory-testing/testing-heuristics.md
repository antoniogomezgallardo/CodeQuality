# Exploratory Testing Heuristics

Testing heuristics are rules of thumb, educated guesses, or mental shortcuts that help guide exploratory testing sessions. They provide structure while maintaining the flexibility that makes exploratory testing valuable.

## üß† General Testing Heuristics

### CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Every data entity should be tested for:
- **Create:** Can new records be added correctly?
- **Read:** Can existing records be retrieved and displayed?
- **Update:** Can records be modified accurately?
- **Delete:** Can records be removed safely?

#### CRUD Testing Questions
- What happens when you create duplicate records?
- Can you read records with special characters?
- What if you update a record that another user is editing?
- What if you try to delete a record that's referenced elsewhere?
- How does the system handle concurrent CRUD operations?

### Goldilocks Testing (Too Little, Too Much, Just Right)
Test with three levels of input:
- **Too Little:** Minimum values, empty fields, null data
- **Too Much:** Maximum values, oversized inputs, flood testing
- **Just Right:** Normal, expected values within valid ranges

#### Examples
- **Text Fields:** Empty string, single character, maximum length + 1
- **Numbers:** Zero, negative, maximum integer values
- **Files:** Empty file, extremely large file, normal-sized file
- **Lists:** Empty list, single item, thousands of items

### Boundary Value Exploration
Focus on the edges and boundaries of input domains:
- **Numeric Boundaries:** -1, 0, 1, MAX_INT, MIN_INT
- **String Boundaries:** Empty, single char, max length
- **Date Boundaries:** Past dates, future dates, leap years
- **Time Boundaries:** Midnight, noon, timezone changes

## üéØ Feature-Specific Heuristics

### Error Handling Heuristics

#### Error Condition Testing
- **Network Issues:** Timeouts, connection drops, slow networks
- **Server Errors:** 500 errors, database unavailable, API failures
- **Client Errors:** JavaScript errors, browser compatibility issues
- **Data Corruption:** Invalid data, encoding issues, format problems

#### Error Message Evaluation
- **Clarity:** Are error messages understandable?
- **Actionability:** Do they tell users what to do next?
- **Security:** Do they reveal sensitive information?
- **Consistency:** Are similar errors handled similarly?

### Security Testing Heuristics

#### Input Validation Testing
- **Injection Attacks:** SQL, XSS, command injection attempts
- **File Upload Security:** Malicious files, oversized files
- **URL Manipulation:** Parameter tampering, path traversal
- **Data Exposure:** Information leakage in error messages

#### Authentication Security
- **Password Security:** Weak passwords, password reuse
- **Session Security:** Session hijacking, fixation attacks
- **Account Security:** Brute force, account enumeration
- **Transport Security:** HTTPS enforcement, SSL/TLS validation

## üé® Creative Testing Heuristics

### Persona-Based Testing
Think like different user types:
- **The Novice:** First-time user, needs guidance
- **The Expert:** Power user, wants efficiency
- **The Skeptic:** Cautious user, worried about security
- **The Impatient:** Wants everything to be fast
- **The Accessible:** Uses assistive technologies

### Scenario-Based Testing
Create realistic user scenarios:
- **Happy Path:** Everything goes as planned
- **Interruption:** User is interrupted mid-task
- **Multi-tasking:** User switches between applications
- **Return User:** User comes back after time away
- **Mobile Context:** User on-the-go with distractions

### Time-Based Testing
Consider timing factors:
- **Rush Testing:** User in a hurry, makes quick decisions
- **Careful Testing:** User takes time, reads everything
- **Peak Hours:** System under high load
- **Off-Hours:** System with minimal load
- **Timezone Testing:** Different time zones and locales
