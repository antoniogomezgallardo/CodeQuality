# Manual Testing Examples

Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases without automation tools. It focuses on exploratory testing, usability, and scenarios that are difficult to automate.

## 🎯 What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing is the process of manually executing test cases by human testers to identify bugs, usability issues, and ensure the software meets requirements. It involves human observation, judgment, and intuition.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test Case Creation

```markdown
1. Review requirements and specifications
2. Identify test scenarios
3. Write detailed test cases
4. Review and approve test cases
5. Execute test cases
6. Report results and defects
```

### Test Execution Process

```markdown
1. Setup test environment
2. Prepare test data
3. Execute test cases step by step
4. Record actual results
5. Compare with expected results
6. Log defects if found
7. Update test case status
```

## 📊 Manual Testing Benefits

- **Human Insight**: Usability and user experience evaluation
- **Exploratory Testing**: Finding unexpected issues
- **Ad-hoc Testing**: Flexibility in test execution
- **Visual Validation**: UI and design verification
