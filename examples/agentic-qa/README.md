## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Agent runs slowly (> 60 seconds)

**Solutions:**
1. Check `OPENAI_MODEL` - use `gpt-4o-mini` for faster responses
2. Reduce context size sent to LLM
3. Enable parallel execution where possible
4. Add timeout limits to prevent hangs

### Too many false positives

**Solutions:**
1. Tune agent prompts with examples from your codebase
2. Implement voting (require 2+ agents to agree)
3. Add human-in-the-loop for low confidence decisions
4. Collect feedback and iterate on prompts

### Exceeding budget

**Solutions:**
1. Set `MAX_COST_PER_RUN` in `.env`
2. Use caching for repeated queries
3. Switch to `gpt-4o-mini` for non-critical decisions
4. Implement smart routing (cheap model first, expensive if needed)

### Agent making wrong decisions

**Solutions:**
1. Add more examples to system prompts
2. Implement verification steps
3. Use structured outputs (Pydantic) to constrain responses
4. Add human approval for high-risk actions
5. Review LangSmith traces to understand reasoning
