- [ ] role="banner" on site header (or use header element)
- [ ] role="contentinfo" on footer (or use footer element)
- [ ] role="button" on clickable divs/spans (or use button element)
- [ ] role="dialog" on modals
- [ ] role="alert" for important error messages
- [ ] role="status" for status updates

### 11.2 ARIA States and Properties

- [ ] aria-expanded on toggleable elements
- [ ] aria-selected on selectable items
- [ ] aria-current on current page/step
