## Executive Summary

### Purpose

This performance test plan defines the strategy, approach, and resources required to validate that the [Application Name] meets its performance requirements under various load conditions.

### Background

[Brief context about the application, recent changes, or reasons for performance testing]

**Example:**
The e-commerce platform is expecting 3x traffic increase during the holiday season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). This performance test validates that the system can handle 10,000 concurrent users making purchases simultaneously while maintaining response times under 2 seconds.

### Key Objectives

- Validate system performance under expected peak load
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Verify system stability under sustained load
- Establish performance baselines for future testing
- Ensure SLA/SLO compliance

#### 1. Load Testing

**Goal:** Verify system behavior under expected load conditions

- Validate application handles expected user load (5,000 concurrent users)
- Measure response times under normal load
- Ensure all transactions complete successfully
- Verify resource utilization stays within acceptable limits

#### 2. Stress Testing

**Goal:** Determine system breaking point and failure modes

- Identify maximum load capacity before degradation
- Test system behavior beyond expected load (up to 15,000 concurrent users)
- Observe failure modes and error handling
- Verify graceful degradation
- Test recovery after stress conditions

#### 3. Endurance Testing (Soak Testing)

**Goal:** Verify system stability over extended periods

- Run at 70% peak load for 8 hours
- Identify memory leaks
- Detect resource exhaustion issues

#### 4. Spike Testing

**Goal:** Test system behavior under sudden load increases

- Simulate sudden traffic spikes (2x load in 30 seconds)
- Verify auto-scaling capabilities
- Test load balancer behavior
- Validate circuit breakers and rate limiting

#### 5. Scalability Testing

**Goal:** Determine how system scales with increased resources

- Test horizontal scaling (adding more instances)
- Test vertical scaling (increasing instance resources)
- Measure scaling efficiency
- Validate auto-scaling policies

### Secondary Objectives

- Establish performance baselines
